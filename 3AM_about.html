            <h1>MEET THE CREW</h1>
            <p><b>3AM Entertainment</b> was created by Brian Arciga and Azael Fregoso after realizing
                that most of their ideas for stories, shows and films came while staying awake
                late at night, often until 3AM. Having been friends and collaborators
                in film-making since high school, starting a film studio felt like the natural
                next step. <b>CINEMEN</b>, the first and currently only <b>3AM Entertainment</b> series,
                draws inspiration from their college years and the challenges they face while 
                pursuing their dreams making it into the film industry.

            <h2>Writer ∙ Actor ∙ Editor</h2>
            <p>Azael is one of the co-creators of <b>3AM Entertainment</b> ! He is a self-proclaimed renaissance
                man with a lot of real estate on his track record. He does everything an artistic soul would
                do from acting to editing, but whose main artistic focus is writing! From episode scripts to 
                screenplays, you’re sure to find a pencil in this playwright’s hand. Be sure to catch him 
                frowning at the camera on set, and also as his character on <b>CINEMEN!</b>

            <p>Damien is an English major turned cinema captain (that was a military ranking joke; 
                please laugh). Damien is the resident boom operator, light operator, and smooth operator
                 for <b>3AM</b>. Without him, the <b>3AM</b> team of 5 would be lost. And maybe his writing will come 
                 in handy for the future of the company! But unfortunately, he has to get in line as 
                 <b>CINEMEN</b> is planned and written up to season 50! Catch Damien as Damien on <b>CINEMEN!</b>

            <p>Davien is the layman of the group, through no fault of his own. He has become somewhat 
                of a mascot within the <b>3AM</b> company. This may be because, like his <b>CINEMEN</b> counterpart, 
                he doesn't do much in the writing, storyboarding, setup, filming, or editing 
                department ... or anything within the group for that matter. However, what he lacks in media prowess, he 
                compensates for by appearing on the show!!! ...Sometimes. Catch Davien reprising his 
                role every five episodes on <b>CINEMEN!</b>
