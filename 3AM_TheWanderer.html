            <h1>BACKGROUND - The Original Short Film</h1>
            <p>In early 2020, Brian and Anthony Arciga started brainstorming for a short film they planned to 
                submit to a local school film festival. All they knew at the time was that they wanted it to be 
                set in a post-apocalyptic world, starring a silent protagonist. For the story, they drew 
                inspiration from movies like <b>Star Wars</b> and <b>Mad Max</b>. It was also decided very early 
                on that only music from the music duo <b>Daft Punk</b> would be used for the soundtrack.
            </p>
            <p>Ruben Aguirre, cousin of Brian and Anthony Arciga, created a thin foam helmet that Brian used 
                to create a prototype of the helmet used in the film. Brian drew inspiration from Hajime 
                Soroyama's "Sexy Robot" art, <b>Power Rangers</b>, and the iconic <b>Daft Punk</b> helmets 
                when designing the helmet. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the school film 
                festival was canceled. Nevertheless, the crew, including Brian, Anthony, Robert Garcia, and 
                Damien Gonzalez, continued to discuss story details. In 2021, Brian created a new and 
                improved helmet using thicker EVA foam.
            </p>
            <p>In 2022, it was announced that the film festival would make a comeback. Brian began working on 
                finalizing the character designs. During this time, Lizzy Garcia also contributed artwork for the 
                Nomad and Vendor, which served as inspiration for their final designs. The crew eventually came 
                together to brainstorm and finalize story beats and details. Robert worked on the nomad costume 
                and the bladed staff. Once the costumes were ready, the crew started scouting for locations. The 
                costumes were brought along for test shots, and some of those shots even made it into the film. The 
                entire filming process took five days. <b>The Wanderer</b> won the best picture award in the 
                "Alumni Productions" category.

            <h1>A NEW DIRECTION - Daft Punk's Split</h1>
            <p>In early 2021, <b>Daft Punk</b> shockingly announced that they would be splitting up. This news 
                came as a big surprise to Brian and Anthony because <b>The Wanderer</b> was originally intended 
                as a tribute to Daft Punk. The film exclusively featured their music, the helmet design was 
                inspired by theirs, and various visuals and locations paid homage to their music videos and film 
                <b>Electroma</b>. It was purely coincidental that the split was announced shortly before filming 
                began.
            </p>
            <p>Originally, the plan was to upload the film festival version of the film to YouTube, however, the crew 
                knew they had something special in their hands. With more time and a larger budget they knew they 
                could produce something bigger, better, and much more polished. After going back and forth, it was 
                unanimously agreed that starting from scratch and going big was the right move. There's been extensive 
                discussions about world building, new characters, as well as plans for future movies, including potential 
                spin-offs so stay tuned!
            </p>
            <p>In 2023, a <b>gofundme</b> page was specifically created for the film (see the support page for 
                more details).

            <h1>OUR PROGRESS</h1>
            <p>Over time, the original foam helmet started to deteriorate, especially the lips. We recreated the 
                helmet in Fusion 360 and now have a 3d print! (Many thanks to Creat'R Lab at UCR for the print!) 
                Currently, we are in the process of sanding the helmet, and it will be completed in the near future. 
                In addition, we are actively working on crafting other costumes and props. We are also working with After 
                Effects to improve the VFX. Thank you for sticking around and follow us on our social media platforms 
                for more updates!
