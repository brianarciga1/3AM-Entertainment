            <p>3AM Entertainment was created by Brian Arciga and Azael Fregoso after realizing
                that most of their ideas for stories, shows and films came while staying awake
                late at night, often until 3AM. Having been friends and collaborators
                in film-making since high school, starting a film studio felt like the natural
                next step. <b>CINEMEN</b>, the first and currently only 3AM Entertainment series,
                draws inspiration from their college years and the challenges they face while 
                pursuing their dreams making it into the film industry.

            <h2>Director ∙ Actor ∙ Editor</h2>
            <p>Brian is one of the co-creators of <b>3AM Entertainment</b> and has served as the director 
                and main editor for all of our projects to date, including <b>CINEMEN</b> and
                <b>The Wanderer</b>. While Brian acts in the productions out of necessity, his true passion
                lies behind the scenes. He has been making movies since he was 12 and show no signs of 
                stopping anytime soon!

            <h1>AZAEL</h1>
            <h2>Writer ∙ Actor ∙ Editor</h2>
            <p>Azael is one of the co-creators of <b>3AM Entertainment</b> ! He is a self-proclaimed renaissance
                man with a lot of real estate on his track record. He does everything an artistic soul would
                do from acting to editing, but whose main artistic focus is writing! From episode scripts to 
                screenplays, you’re sure to find a pencil in this playwright’s hand. Be sure to catch him 
                frowning at the camera on set, and also as his character on <b>CINEMEN</b> !
